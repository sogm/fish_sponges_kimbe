The files provided require the modification of the path by the user in order to generate the analysis outputs. The files contain the data in .csv format and the code in .Rmd files that were used to generate the analysis of fish communities inhabiting encrusting sponge dominated environments. The analysis are related to observational and experimental approaches to test whether overgrowth of corals by encrusting sponges is impacting fish assemblages by reducing coral cover and substratum complexity. Firstly, fish assemblages were compared in 36 3x3m quadrats with low (<5%), medium (5-20%) and high (>20%) sponge cover. Secondly, fish response to the experimental removal of sponges from 12 additional high sponge cover quadrats (>20%) was quantified
